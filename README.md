# Kubernetes Resources Repository

Welcome to the Kubernetes Resources Repository! This repository is a collection of tools, guides, and configurations designed to help you install, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters, particularly on-premise installations on Ubuntu 22.04. Additionally, you'll find useful cheat sheets and manifest files for various Kubernetes deployments.

## Directory Structure

- `K8s_install/Ubuntu_2204`: Contains detailed instructions and necessary images for installing Kubernetes on-premise on Ubuntu 22.04 systems.
- `Sheet_sets`: Includes a cheat sheet with common Kubernetes commands to assist you in managing your cluster.
- `Deployment_manifests`: A new directory containing YAML manifest files for setting up different Kubernetes deployments.

## What's Inside

### Kubernetes Installation Guide

The `K8s_install` directory provides step-by-step guides for setting up Kubernetes on your own servers. It's tailored for Ubuntu 22.04 but the principles can be applied to other Linux distributions with some adjustments.

### Day 2 Operations

Inside the installation directory, you'll also find documentation on 'Day 2' operations â€“ the essential tasks required once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running. This includes scaling, monitoring, and updating your cluster.

### Cheat Sheets

The `Sheet_sets` directory contains a handy cheat sheet that I've shared previously. It's a quick reference guide to the most commonly used Kubernetes commands, saving you time and making cluster management more efficient.

### Deployment Manifests

The newly added `Deployment_manifests` directory is where you'll find YAML files for deploying various applications and services within your Kubernetes cluster. These are ready-to-use templates that can be customized to fit your specific needs.
